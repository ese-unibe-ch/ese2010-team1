~ Name:

~ test -- Run the application in test mode in the current shell
~ 
~ Synopsis:
~ ~~~~~~~~~
~ play test [app_path] [-f] [--java_options]
~
~ Description:
~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Run the application hosted at the app_path directory. If app_path is omitted, the current directory is used.
~ The application is run in foreground in the current shell. You can then stop it using Ctrl+C.
~
~ The application is run in test mode: the framework ID is forced to 'test' and a web test runner is automatically
~ started at the /@tests URL.
~
~ The script first tries to locate the java command using the $JAVA_HOME environment variable (from $JAVA_HOME/bin).
~ If the $JAVA_HOME variable is not defined, the default java command available from the PATH is used.
~
~ All options specified after the application path are passed to the JVM (example. -Xms=64m -Xmx=256m).
~ All the shell environment variables are passed to the JVM.
~
~ A JPDA session is automatically opened on the port specified by the conf/application.conf file's jpda.port property
~ file (default to 8000). If the JPDA port is already used, another available port is automatically chosen.
~
~ Options:
~ ~~~~~~~~~
~ -f: 
~ Disable the JPDA port checking and force the jpda.port value.
